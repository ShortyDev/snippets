### How to add your own snippet
If you add a new snippet, the code file has to be added to `public/snippets/` following the naming convention:
- The name of the file has to look like this `0_YOURNAME_INDEX`
- Your name has to be in the first part of the file name, separated by an underscore
- The index has to be a number, it's unique to each user, starting with 0
- The ending has to correspond to the language of the snippet
- Example of John's first python snippet: `0_John_0.py`

The snippets details have to be added to `components/snippets/desc.json` following the convention.
